# <JS_Password_Generator>

## Description

I worked around some ways to add proper function to this Password Generator.
With this Generator, I was able to create a prompt, and a few confirm boxes to add some styling.
Uniquely, this should prompt a new password everytime.

## Usage

You'll be able to use this generator to really add up some exclusivity and privacy to your passwords by mixing in numbers, characters, lower case letters, and capital letters!
Keep in mind, you can generate a password between 8 and 128 characters in length. Meaning, if you plan to make a very long password, remember to save, write down, or memorize your unique password!
